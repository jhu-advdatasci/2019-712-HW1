In 2017, Baltimore put out a city-wide call asking for Baltimore residents to avoid having any murders through quarterly Ceasefires and Peace Challenges (February, May, August, and November). 
This became known as [Baltimore Ceasefire 365](https://baltimoreceasefire.com).

Imagine you are a data scientist working for the city of Baltimore where you help government officials implement and evaluate policies rolled out by looking and analyzing data. 
Recently, you have been contacted by [Monica Valdes Lupi, the Executive Director from the Boston Public Health Commission](https://www.bphc.org/aboutus/office-director/Pages/office--of-director.aspx) who is interested in exploring the idea of implementing a similar city-wide ceasefire call in Boston to reduce gun deaths. 
She wants to know 

* Do the Baltimore ceasefires lead to a reduction in gun-related murders? Can you quantify any change in gun-related deaths during ceasefire weekends? 

* Is this a city-wide call you would recommend Boston implement in their own city? Is there any data that would suggest that such a policy would or would not be effective in Boston?

* Is there anything else that should be considered before making any decision about this policy?

In this homework assignment, you will be exploring these questions, summarizing your results, and giving a final recommendation to Monica. 

**Helpful hints**: You will find the [Open Baltimore data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov) useful for obtain crime data on shootings or homicides with a firearm.
